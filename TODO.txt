BUGS(uncategorized): {{{

 - WM_VSCROLL hack fires even when textBuffer has keyboard focus
   OR call to SetTextSelection() in AppendText() is doing it
   either way you can't scroll in a super active channel which is the only
   time you really need scroll

 - channelList not populated sometimes
   - 321 ALWAYS comes before 322 
     but if goirc.HandleFunc is just doing go handler() indiscriminately
     which would cause a 322 to get handled before a 321 sometimes at random
     that's another reason to get rid of goirc

     because we *do* want to ignore 322 if the channelList tab was closed atm

     NOTE(tso): unrelated
     userstory storytime:
        " hey what channels are on this network
        " oh shit there are 20,000
        " */list*
        " *server sends 20,000 lines*
        " let's sort by most popular oh this one looks good
        " *closes channel list tab*
        " *client is still receiving 20,000 lines*
        " oh nvm this channel is dead let's see that list again
        " /list

        WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN CHOOSE YOUR ADVENTURE:

        [1] "still getting list results from last time, try again later"
        (what we do now)

        [2] display the still-incoming list results as-is 
        (confusing to user)

        [3] always store all of the list results in a separate array on
            serverState structure instead of relying on channelListModel
            and add a Refresh button to channelList 
            which is disabled until we get ENDOFLIST (323 I assume)
        (A WINNER IS YOU)

        we're basically just recreating xchat at this point

  - tab close behavior is screwy but I don't want to mess with it rn

richedit {{{

FIX PROBLEMS:
 - richedit jumps up like 20 lines or scrolls past the end find out whats
   going on with that it has to do with when its focused or not
   dont just spam WM_VSCROLL although thats probably the solution

 - appendtext/linecount

CREATE NEW PROBLEMS:
 - /search or /find or CTRL+F
    - perfect world: reduce text buffer to matches, then restore
    - real world: jump to selection
 
 - selection automatically goes to clipboard
}}}

(*actual todo list) {{{

 - unicode characters display in a shitty font make sure Universalia is
   used if the text isn't ascii  

 - /part without closing tab
     - chanState tracks whether "connected" to channel?

 - split extra long text input
     - maxlen is 450..512
     - ctrl+enter inserts \n
     - split on \n, send multiple lines
     - dialog box: warn about sending > 2 lines

 - don't log lines if DISCONNECTED

 - don't display lines if not sent

 - don't open privmsg tab if not sent

walk {{{

PROBLEMS:
 
 - nickListBox gets resized back to nonzero when window is resized even
   though the PushButton will hide it again with 1 click maybe something like
   a "hidden" on the nickList and an event on MainWindow
    - there is an event that fires on window resize

EXPLORE A NEW WORLD OF OPPORTUNITY:
 - keyboard nav 
  
 - system tray icon
     - hide to tray
     - notifications balloons for highlight (if !mainWindowFocused)

 - figure out how to make the window flash orange in the task bar

 - transparency?

new feature {{{

 - topic widget should allow input and send /topic or whatever
   after: replace topicInput with a RichEdit to display colors and links 

 - highlight list

    - support for patterns

 - word filter
    - e.g. "fuck" => "****"
    - or 4chan style "fam" => "desu"

 - limit scrollback to n lines

 - load chatlog on join

bikeshedding {{{

 - testing
     - it would be nice if we could test the UI 
       without having to connect to a network 
         - one of each type of tab opens up 
         - each with examples of every type of information it can display in
           all states
         - just for the sake of designing
         - doesn't have any logic
         - separate application
         - would probably have to split project into subpackages (yuck)
           - no wait we could do what we did when testing richedit
             // +build ignore
             
             go build testapp.go *:not(main) # wait this isn't css

     - it would be nice if we could test the logic by faking a connection e.g.
       by sending raw IRC lines e.g.
       ":host@nowhere PRIVMSG #fakechannelfortesting :test\n"
       on a simple channel or something so there's nothing complicated about
       mocking a connection if only it were that easy

 - replace goirc with simple channels and goroutines
    yay:
         - /reconnect is impossible for some reason
         - logger interface is inconvenient
         - no convenient way to capture unhandled server messages 
         - it would be trivial to mock connections by just sending raw IRC
           lines on the recv chan
           see MockConnection() in irc/irc.go
         - all handlers run in their own goroutines so even though messages
           always come in in a particular order the handlers can run in any
           order which is causing me all sorts of issues 
            - with LIST sometimes we get a LIST result before LISTSTART so the
              channellist tab hasn't been created yetbut the server sent
              LISTSTART first.
            - with NAMES and 332 sometimes one comes before the other and we
              need to create the channel tab in either case (and not on JOIN
              because user could have mode +b or channel could be +s) so it's
              a race condition and conceivably two tabs could open though I
              haven't seen that happen yet (I was consistently not getting 332
              displaying in the buffer but that was because the tab creation
              itself happens asynchronously as well)
            - this could all be a misunderstanding on my part but I'm pretty
              sure it would be better to dispatch handlers asynchronously only
              if/when the ui state is known instead of having to sync up
              inside of those handlers
              of course it would be much easier to understand if we just did
              everything line-by-line and didn't introduce goroutines at all
              but I worry that would cause a laggy/unresponsive chat
              experience like cybits used to exhibit whenever an http request
              took a long time.

              I don't see how it would be a problem to just:
              
              line := <-recv
              cmd, args := parseLine(line)
              switch cmd {
              // ...
              case PRIVMSG:
                if !tabExists(args.dest) {
                    createTab(args.dest)
                }
                go privmsgHandler(args)

                like I want to believe that would solve everything and seems
                less pants-on-head than

                go privmsgHandler()

                func privmsgHandler{
                    if !tabExists ...

                    like we're doing now

            like I don't get how doing some blocking stuff for a few cycles
            that's necessary to have a consistent state is a bad thing what am
            I missing?

    nay:
         - it works
         - has anti-flooding stuff
         - line parsing might be harder than it looks

 - replace walk with qt 
    ... for version 2.0

    yay:
         - inline images for emojis and embedding thumbnails 
         - richedit is hella annoying

    nay:
        - walk is hella comfy
        - sunken cost fallacy (I've spent a lot of time getting stuff to work)
        
 - irc bouncer (separate project)
     - use public/private key pairs for authentication or something
     - basically just a relay/proxy that PING/PONGs when the user isn't connected
     - stores messages while user isn't connected, dumps (user configurable
       amount) on reconnect
     - autoreply or maybe just (Away)!
     - *** this sort of thing might be against IRC network rules need to look into
       what the policy is and/or how znc does it so well
       or just use znc

RE: inserting images in RichEdit

nvm OLE is exceptionally awful and I can't figure out how to get the
OBJECTPOSITIONS messages so fuck it if we want more out of the UI than pretty
colors there's always walk.WebView, electron, Qt, or reinventing the wheel
(render text and handle pointer events for text selection and put stuff on the
clipboard manually and invent a scrollbar and waste like a solid year on that)

RE: splitting main into subpackages

or "issues nobody raised yet but inevitably will part 1"

who's going to import and use github.com/generaltso/chopsuey/widgets
or github.com/generaltso/chopsuey/colors or messages or whatever?
nobody that's who because most of this code is specific to this application

if the argument is well you should make the code decoupled for reuse,
who other than another client or an overly complicated bot is going 
to use this code? authors of those things tend to want to roll their own
anyway. 

if it's for testing purposes, there's no reason not to add tests for
the main package since `go test` doesn't call main and most things are
testable as they are right now (with the notable exception of not being able
to mock the serverConnection which will go away if/when I replace goirc)

and if the argument is it will make the code easier to maintain I would kindly
ask for an example because I've never seen a project where having to grep -r
(or is it -R) and jump around multiple files in multiple directories trying to
figure out where functions are called and things are happening makes anything
easier to understand

Furthermore, worrying about which symbols need to be exported or needing to
use .mod files is an undue source of complexity and headaches for a project of
this scope

Splitting an **application** into multiple subpackages is an antipattern imho
unless that application has what are effectively its own libraries that are
potentially useful for other applications to import. In that case, I'm not
opposed to the idea, in fact I made a basic webapp framework based on what I
did in caffochoco and caffochoco-mythril (I lost what I think was the only copy
of the code to a hard drive crash...) but in that case where you can get
started on a new application by just import'ing what you already have *is*
really useful but tbh that's simply not the case here and separating all that
logic would be a lot of work for literally no gain, the examples provided with
walk are better at showing how to scaffold a new app 

If you follow what I'm saying then you'll understand why the (go) channels-
based irc connection is its own package

If you're still convinced I'm wrong I encourge you to refactor everything
yourself and fork (off)
