richedit {{{

FIX PROBLEMS:
 - richedit jumps up like 20 lines or scrolls past the end find out whats
   going on with that it has to do with when its focused or not
   dont just spam WM_VSCROLL although thats probably the solution

 - style bleed is still happening in RichEdit textBuffers
    - now I want to try adding some zero-width characters and
      styling them with AUTOCOLOR (need to test that AUTOCOLOR even does
      anything on visible text)

CREATE NEW PROBLEMS:
 - /search or /find or CTRL+F
    - perfect world: reduce text buffer to matches, then restore
    - real world: jump to selection
 
 - selection automatically goes to clipboard

(*actual todo list) {{{

 - /list shouldn't work on a disconnected server (but guess what)

 - bold/italic/underline toggles don't work
    - colors.go needs a major overhaul 

 - statusBar is just really inconsistent
    - disconnecting from one server makes all servers display "disconnected x_x"

 - nick with prefix e.g. @channelop should be without prefix in ACTION

 - unicode characters display in a shitty font make sure Universalia is
   used if the text isn't ascii  

 - whitespace or something to indicate where unread messages start

 - CTCP messages should appear somewhere in UI

 - /part without closing tab
     - chanState tracks whether "connected" to channel?

 - split extra long text input
     - maxlen is 450..512
     - ctrl+enter inserts \n
     - split on \n, send multiple lines
     - dialog box: warn about sending > 2 lines

 - don't log lines if DISCONNECTED

 - don't display lines if not sent
    - e.g. cannot send to channel (+m)
}}}

walk {{{

PROBLEMS:
 - draw issue when
    1) open /list from #channel
    2) click to channel list tab
    3) click to server tab

    fixes itself when you click on #channel again

    - this also can happen when you /join from a privmsg
      so it probably has to do with how the tabPage being inserted and not
      being shown right away messes with the WM_PAINT or something
      i really don't know

 - nickListBox gets resized back to nonzero when window is resized even
   though the PushButton will hide it again with 1 click maybe something like
   a "hidden" on the nickList and an event on MainWindow

 - we should ReleaseDC() after closing tabs 

EXPLORE A NEW WORLD OF OPPORTUNITY:
 - keyboard nav 
  
 - system tray icon
     - hide to tray
     - notifications balloons for highlight (if !mainWindowFocused)

 - figure out how to make the window flash orange in the task bar

 - enable_caption(0)

 - transparency?
}}}

new feature {{{

 - topic widget should allow input and send /topic or whatever
   after: replace topicInput with a RichEdit to display colors and links 

 - highlight list
    - probably should compile regexp for that since its more complex
    - needs dialog, maybe just use TextEdit
    - support for patterns

 - word filter
    - e.g. "fuck" => "****"
    - or 4chan style "fam" => "desu"

 - limit scrollback to n lines

 - load chatlog on join
}}}

big project/refactor {{{

 - new server tab/connection abstraction

 - make empty server tab possible
}}}
---
commands {{{

 - usage text and descriptions for all commands in a map.

 - /mode needs to be able to send just the channel e.g. MODE #test
   to get a reply of what the mode is
   expected: /mode #channel
             Mode for #channel is +CSnpstz
             /mode tso
             tso (221: +Sirx)

 - ditto for /topic
   expected: /topic
             Topic for #channel is "words" set by tso at 7/12/2018 11:54:18 PM

 - /welcome
    - first run welcome message
    - ascii art logo
    - contact + link to github
    - getting started
      /server irc.example.org +
      /join #channel
      hi
    - /help for more information

 - tab completion for commands

need dialog box for better management of lists:
 - /ignore
    - /unignore
 - /invite
    - /uninvite
 - /kickban

easy:
 - /whois
 - /version
 - /away
 - /unaway

extensions {{{

 - inline twitter links

bikeshedding {{{

 - replace goirc with simple channels and goroutines
    yay:
         - /reconnect is impossible for some reason
         - logger interface is inconvenient
         - no convenient way to capture unhandled server messages 

    nay:
         - it works
         - has anti-flooding stuff
         - line parsing might be harder than it looks

 - replace walk with qt 
    ... for version 2.0

    yay:
         - inline images for emojis and embedding thumbnails 
         - richedit is hella annoying

    nay:
        - walk is hella comfy
        
 - irc bouncer (separate project)
     - use public/private key pairs for authentication or something
     - basically just a relay/proxy that PING/PONGs when the user isn't connected
     - stores messages while user isn't connected, dumps (user configurable
       amount) on reconnect
     - autoreply or maybe just (Away)!
     - *** this sort of thing might be against IRC network rules need to look into
       what the policy is and/or how znc does it so well
       or just use znc
}}}

colors {{{

 - write more test cases

 - strip control codes from other parts of the ui (like channel list)

 - SEND COLORS
    - shorthand `red:no u`
    - ctrl+k inserts \x03
    - ctrl+b inserts \x02
    - etc...
    - NOTE(tso): you can already send control codes with scripting

 - unique random colors for nicks

 - themes

 - mouse
     - middle-click to close tabs
     - scroll to cycle through tabs
     - context menu

BETTER CONTEXT MENU IDEA OMG
 - list
   of
   current

   channels (and privmsgs)
   !!

 - keyboard
    - ctrl+t for empty server tab
    - ctrl+tab to 
        
 - windows styles
     - multiline
     - stretch-to-fit
     - button style

ADDENDUM: {{{

RE: inserting images in RichEdit

nvm OLE is exceptionally awful and I can't figure out how to get the
OBJECTPOSITIONS messages so fuck it if we want more out of the UI than pretty
colors there's always walk.WebView, electron, Qt, or reinventing the wheel
(render text and handle pointer events for text selection and put stuff on the
clipboard manually and invent a scrollbar and waste like a solid year on that)
